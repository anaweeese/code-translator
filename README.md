# A Seamless Programming Code Translation Service
This repository serves the purpose of storing all code related to the creation of a translation service that translates code across multiple programming languages. 
## Programming Languages
The programming translation service will offer translation capability across the following programming languages:
* Python
* Java
## Starter Capabilities:
The service will continue in the development stage until it can seamlessly perform the following tasks:
* Parse string code and translate looping structures from the origin programming language into the desired one.
* Implement appropriate handling of container variables in both translation directions.
* Return the translated code as a program file in the target programming language.
